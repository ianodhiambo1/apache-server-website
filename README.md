# My Website Project

## Project Description

This project is a simple web application designed with PHP, HTML, and CSS, featuring user signup and login functionalities. It also demonstrates basic routing, session management, and MySQL database interaction. The application is designed to manage user accounts and demonstrate secure login processes.

### Features

- User Registration (Sign Up)
- User Login with Session Management
- Password Hashing for Security
- Basic CSS for Simple UI
- Routing using a Central `index.php`
- Integration with MySQL database (`CAT1`)

## Project Structure

Here’s an overview of the project structure:

```
/var/www/html/
│
├── db.php            # Handles database connection
├── index.php         # Main router for the website
├── signup.php        # User signup page
├── login.php         # User login page
├── home.php          # Home page after successful login
├── styles.css        # Basic CSS for form styling
├── .gitignore        # Git ignore file (excludes sensitive files)
├── README.md         # This README file
```

### Database Schema

The project uses a MySQL database called `CAT1` with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE CAT1;

USE CAT1;

CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to run the project on your local server:

### Prerequisites

- **PHP 7.4+**: Make sure PHP is installed on your machine.
- **MySQL 5.7+**: Required for database interaction.
- **Apache/Nginx**: A web server like Apache is necessary to serve the PHP files.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-website.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-website
   ```

3. Set up the MySQL database:

   - Create a database named `CAT1` in MySQL:

     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE CAT1;
     ```

   - Use the `db.php` file to configure the database credentials. Update `username`, `password`, and `hostname` accordingly in `db.php`:

     ```php
     $servername = "localhost";
     $username = "your_db_username";  // Update with your MySQL username
     $password = "your_db_password";  // Update with your MySQL password
     $dbname = "CAT1";
     ```

4. Import the database schema into MySQL:

   ```bash
   mysql -u your_db_username -p CAT1 < database.sql
   ```

5. Serve the application via a local server (Apache/Nginx) or use PHP’s built-in server for testing:

   ```bash
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

6. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000/index.php?page=signup` to sign up new users or to `http://localhost:8000/index.php?page=login` to log in.

## Usage

### Signup

1. Go to the signup page at `http://localhost/index.php?page=signup`.
2. Enter the required details: username, email, and password.
3. Once submitted, the user is registered in the `users` table of the `CAT1` database.

### Login

1. Navigate to the login page at `http://localhost/index.php?page=login`.
2. Provide the username and password used during registration.
3. Upon successful login, you'll be redirected to the home page, which will display a welcome message and provide a logout link.

### Logout

1. Once logged in, you can log out by navigating to `index.php?page=logout`.

## CSS Styling

Basic form styling is provided in the `styles.css` file. You can modify this file to change the look and feel of the login and signup pages.

## Security

- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are securely hashed using PHP’s `password_hash()` function before storing them in the database.
- **SQL Injection Protection**: The project uses prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

### Challenges

- **Database Connection**: Setting up the correct database credentials and ensuring connection stability was a challenge initially.
- **Session Management**: Managing user sessions to keep users logged in across multiple pages required understanding PHP sessions thoroughly.
- **Security**: Implementing secure password hashing and avoiding SQL injection were important considerations for building a safe application.

### Lessons Learned

- Gained experience in setting up a basic web app using PHP and MySQL.
- Learned how to manage user authentication securely using password hashing.
- Understood routing in PHP using query strings and conditional includes.
